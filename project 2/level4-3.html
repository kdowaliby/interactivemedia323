	<div class="text">Musical instruments <div class="line">sleep in the dark </div> for several hours a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work. Our silence holds music: an <div class="line">undiscovered bourne, horizons</div> which have never been viewed, like <div class="line">undeclared love</div> growing deeper in solitude, or the <div class="line">crystalline heart of a stone.</div> My sleep, however, was more like a <div class="line">death:  in the dark</div> of an attic for years;  <div class="line">forgetting my existence,</div> and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth. I was the great <div class="line">love of my Sweetheart's life. </div> A man came between us. And soon  I was in the dark collecting <div class="line">dust and out of tune;</div> they were pronounced man and wife. 
	Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, <div class="line">once a year . . . </div>At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has <div class="line">ruined my voice. </div> Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass.  But that doesn't mean <div>I've lost hope . . .</div>that someone will hold me in a <div class="line">tender embrace</div>, her arms will encircle my neck;  someone will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with <div class="line">her fingers' caress.</div> </div>
