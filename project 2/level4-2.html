	<div class="line">instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day:</div> 

	<div class="line2">the folks we <div class="belong">belong</div> to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work.</div>

	<div class="line3">Our silence holds music: an <div class="undiscovered">undiscovered</div> bourne, horizons which have never been viewed,</div>

	<div class="line4">like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline <div class="heart">heart</div> of a stone.</div>

	<div class="line5">My sleep, however, was more like a <div class="death">death: </div> in the dark of an attic for years; </div>

	<div class="forgetting">forgetting</div>
	<div class="line6">my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth.</div>

	<div class="line7">I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came <div class="between">between</div>us. And soon </div>

	<div class="line8">I was in the dark collecting <div class="dust">dust</div> and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife.</div>

	<div class="line9">Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a <div class="year">year</div>...At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. </div>

	<div class="line10">My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has <div class="ruined">ruined</div> my voice. </div>

	<div class="line11">Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. But that doesn't mean I've lost <div class="hope">hope</div></div>

	<div class="line12">. . .that someone will hold me in a tender <div class="embrace">embrace,</div>her arms will encircle my neck; </div>

	<div class="line13">someone will press <div class="her">her</div> warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress. </div>
