	Musical instruments sleep in the <div class="line">dark </div>for several hours a day:  the folks we <div class="line">belong</div>to aren't always at play, so we <div class="line">can't</div> always be at work. 
	Our <div class="line">silence</div> holds music: an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed, like undeclared love growing deeper in <div class="line">solitude</div>, or the <div class="line">crystalline</div>heart of a stone. 
	My sleep, however, was more like a <div class="line">death</div>:  in the dark of an attic for years;  forgetting my <div class="line">existence</div>, and my <div class="line">glorious</div> career with the best female swing band on the earth. 
	I was the great <div class="line">love</div> of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came between us. And soon  I was in the <div class="line">dark</div> collecting dust and out of <div class="line">tune</div>; they were pronounced man and wife. 
	Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, <div class="line">once</div> a year . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to <div class="line">hear</div> her family's coninuo of talk. 
	My <div class="line">Sweetheart's</div> grandson brought me to the shop. Something has <div class="line">ruined</div>my voice.  <div class="line">Older</div>, not riper, I'm a sorry old <div class="line">bass</div>.  But that doesn't mean I've lost <div class="line">hope</div> 
	. . .that someone will hold me in a <div class="line">tender</div> embrace, her arms will <div class="line">encircle</div> my neck;  <div class="line">someone</div> will press her warm length to my back,  and pluck notes from my gut with her <div class="line">fingers'</div> caress. </div>
