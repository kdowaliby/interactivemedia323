	<div class="line1">Musical instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day: </div>
	<div class="line2">the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work.</div>
	<div class="line3">Our silence holds music: an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed, like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone.</div>
	<div class="line4">My sleep, however, was more like a death:  in the dark of an attic for years;</div>
	<div class="line5">forgetting my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth.</div>
	<div class="line6">I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life. A man came between us.</div>
	<div class="line7">And soon  I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife.</div>
	<div class="line8">Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . . </div>
	<div class="line9">At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice.</div>
	<div class="line10">Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass.  But that doesn't mean I've lost hope. . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck; </div> 
	<div class="line11">someone will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress.</div>
