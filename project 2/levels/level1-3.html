		<P>"Musical instruments sleep in the dark "</P>
    <br>
    	<p>"for several &nbsp;hours a day:"</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work."</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"Our silence holds music: an &nbsp;undiscovered&nbsp; bourne, horizons which have never been viewed, "</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone."</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"My sleep, however, was more like a &nbsp;&nbsp;death:"</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"forgetting my &nbsp;existence,&nbsp; and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth."</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life. "</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"A man came between&nbsp; us"</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"And soon"</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife."</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . ."</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"At first, from my closet, I was able to &nbsp;hear her family's coninuo of talk."</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice."</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. "</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"But that doesn't mean I've lost hope"</p>
    <br>
    	<p>". . .that someone will hold me in a &nbsp;tender embrace,&nbsp; her arms will encircle my neck; "</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"someone will press her &nbsp;warm length&nbsp; to my back"</p>
    <br>
    	<p>"and &nbsp;pluck&nbsp; notes from my gut with her fingers' caress."</p>
