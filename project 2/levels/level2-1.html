	<h2>"Our silence holds music:"</h2>
	<p>"an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed,  like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone."</p>

	<p>"A man came between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>us</em>."</p>
	<p>"Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has <em>ruined</em> my voice. "</p>
	<p>"Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. But that doesn't mean I've lost hope. . .that <strong>someone</strong> will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck; "</p>
	<div></div>
	<p>"<strong>someone</strong> will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress. "</p>
