	<h1>"Musical instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day: "</h1>
	<h2>"the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work."</h2>
	<h3>"Our <strong>silence</strong> holds music:"</h3>
	<h4>" an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed,"</h4>
	<h5>"like undeclared love growing deeper in <strong>solitude,</strong> or the <strong>crystalline</strong> heart of a stone."</h5>
	<h6>"My sleep, however, was more like a <strong>death:</strong>"</h6>
	<h1>"in the dark of an attic for years;"</h1>
	<h2>"forgetting my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth."</h2>
	<h3>"I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came between us."</h3>
	<h4>"And soon  I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife."</h4>
	<h5>"Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . ."</h5>
	<h6>"At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk."</h6>
	<h1>"My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice."</h1>
	<h2>"Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. But that doesn't mean I've lost hope"</h2>
	<h3>". . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck; "</h3>
	<h4>"someone will press her warm length to my back, "</h4>
	<h5>"and pluck notes from my gut"</h5>
	<h6>"with her fingers' caress."</h6>
