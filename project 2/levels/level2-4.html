	<p>"Musical instruments <strong>sleep</strong> in the dark  for several hours a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work. Our <strong>silence</strong> holds music: an <em>undiscovered bourne,</em> <strong>horizons</strong> which have never been viewed, like undeclared <em>love growing deeper</em> in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"My <strong>sleep,</strong> however, was more like a <em>death:"</em></p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"in the <em>dark</em> of an attic for years;  forgetting my existence, and my <Strong>glorious</Strong> career with the best female swing band on the earth. I was the <em>great love</em> of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came between us. And soon  I was in the <strong>dark</strong> collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played <em>once a week, once a year</em> . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's <strong>coninuo</strong> of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has <strong>ruined</strong> my voice."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"<strong>Older,</strong> not <em>riper,</em> I'm a sorry <em>old</em> bass.  But that doesn't mean I've <strong>lost</strong> hope "</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>". . .that <strong>someone</strong> will hold me in a <em>tender embrace,</em> her arms will encircle my neck;  <strong>someone</strong> will press her warm length to my back, and <em>pluck notes</em> from my gut with her fingers' caress. "</p>
