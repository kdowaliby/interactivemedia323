	<p>"Musical instruments <h2>sleep</h2> in the dark  for <h2>several hours</h2> a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work. Our <h2>silence</h2> holds music: an <h2>undiscovered</h2> bourne, <h2>horizons</h2> which have never been <h2>viewed, </h2>like <h2>undeclared</h2> love growing deeper in <h2>solitude,</h2> or the <h2>crystalline</h2> heart of a stone. My sleep, however, was more like a <h2>death: </h2> in the <h2>dark</h2> of an attic for years;  <h2>forgetting</h2> my <h2>existence,</h2> and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth. I was the <h2>great</h2> love of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came between us. And soon  I was in the <h2>dark</h2> collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife. Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a <h2>year</h2> . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. . . .that <h2>someone</h2> will <h2>hold me</h2> in a tender embrace, her arms will <h2>encircle my neck; </h2> someone will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her <h2>fingers' caress."</h2></p>
