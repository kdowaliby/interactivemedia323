	<p class="Musical">Musical instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work.</p>
	<p class="our">Our silence holds music: an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed, </p>
	<p class="like">like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone.</p>
	<p class="My">My sleep, however, was more like a death:</p>
	<p class="in">in the dark of an attic for years;  forgetting my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth.</p>
	<p class="I">I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came between us. And soon  I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife.</p>
	<p class="Instead">Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice. </p>
	<p class="Older">Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. But that doesn't mean I've lost hope</p>
	<p class="that">. . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck; someone will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress. </p>
