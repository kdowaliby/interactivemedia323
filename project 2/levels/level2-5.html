	<p>"Musical instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work."</p>
	<br>
	<p>"Our silence holds music: <span style= "color:blue">an <em>undiscovered</em> bourne, horizons which have never been viewed,"</span></p>
	<br>
	<p>"like undeclared love growing deeper in <strong>solitude, or the crystalline <span style= "color:red">heart</span> of a stone.</strong>"</p>
	<br>
	<p>"My sleep, however, was more like a <span style= "color:darkred"><strong><em>death:  in the dark</em></strong></span> of an attic for years; forgetting my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth."</p>
	<br>
	<p>"I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life.  <em>A man came between us.</em> And soon  <strong>I was in the <em>dark</em> collecting dust and out of tune;</strong> they were pronounced man and wife."</p>
	<br>
	<p>"Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . . At first, from my closet, I was <em>able to hear</em> her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has <span style= "color:maroon"><em>ruined</em></span> my voice."</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong><"Older, not riper, <span style= "color:lightblue">I'm a sorry old bass. </span> But that doesn't mean I've lost hope"</strong></p>
	<br>
	<p><em>". . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck;"</em></p>
	<br>
	<p><em>"someone</em> will press her <span style= "color:pink"><em>warm</em></span> length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress. "</p>
