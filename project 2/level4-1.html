	<div class="box">Musical instruments <strong>sleep</strong> in the <strong>dark </strong>for several hours a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work. Our silence holds music: <strong>an undiscovered bourne,</strong> horizons which have never been viewed, like <strong>undeclared</strong> love growing <strong>deeper in solitude,</strong> or the <strong>crystalline heart of a stone.</strong> My sleep, however, was more <strong>like a death:  in the dark</strong> of an attic for years;  <strong>forgetting my existence,</strong> and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the <strong>earth</strong>. I was the great love of my Sweetheart's <strong>life</strong>.  <strong>A man came between us.</strong> And soon  I was in the <strong>dark</strong> collecting dust and <strong>out of tune;</strong> they were pronounced <strong>man and wife.</strong> Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a <strong>year . . . </strong>At first, from my closet, <strong>I was able to hear</strong> her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has <strong>ruined my voice. </strong> Older, not riper, I'm a <strong>sorry</strong> old bass.  <strong>But that doesn't mean I've lost hope. . .</strong>that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will <strong>encircle my neck; </strong> someone will press her warm length to my back,  and pluck notes from my gut with her <strong>fingers' caress.</strong></div>
