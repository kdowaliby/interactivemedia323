	<h3>"A man came between us. And soon I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife."</h3>
	<div class="voice">Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice. </div>

	<h5>Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. But that doesn't mean I've lost hope. . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck; </h5>

	<p>someone will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress.</p>
