	<div>Musical instruments sleep in the dar k for several hours a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work.</div>
	<div>Our silence holds music: an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed,  like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone.</div>
	<div>My sleep, however, was more like a death:  in the dark of an attic for years;  forgetting my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth.</div> 
	<div>I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came between us. And soon  I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife.</div>
	<div>Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year. . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk.</div>
	<div>My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice.  Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. </div><div>But that doesn't mean I've lost hope. . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck;  someone will press her warm length to my back,  and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress.</div>
