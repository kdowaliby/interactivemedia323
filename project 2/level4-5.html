	<div class="line">Musical instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day: </div>

	<div id="text">the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work. Our silence holds music:</div> 

	<div class="line">an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed, like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude,</div>

	<div id="text">or the crystalline heart of a stone. My sleep, however, was more like a death: in the dark of an attic for years; </div>

	<div class="line">forgetting my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth.</div> 
	
	<div id="text">I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life. A man came between us. And soon  I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife.</div>

	<div class="line">Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk.</div>

	<div id="text">My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice.  Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. </div>

	<div class="line">But that doesn't mean I've lost hope. . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck; </div> 

	<div id="text">someone will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress.</div>
