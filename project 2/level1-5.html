	<P>"Musical instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day:  the folks we &nbsp;&nbsp;belong to aren't always at play,&nbsp;&nbsp; so we can't always be at work. Our silence holds music:&nbsp;&nbsp; an undiscovered bourne,&nbsp;&nbsp; horizons&nbsp;&nbsp; which have never been viewed, like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone."</P>
	<br>
	<p>"My sleep, however, was more like a &nbsp;&nbsp;death: &nbsp;&nbsp;in the dark of an attic for years; &nbsp;&nbsp;forgetting&nbsp;&nbsp; my &nbsp;&nbsp;existence,&nbsp;&nbsp; and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth. I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life.  A man came &nbsp;&nbsp;between&nbsp;&nbsp; us. And soon  I was in the &nbsp;&nbsp;dark&nbsp;&nbsp; collecting dust and &nbsp;&nbsp;out&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; tune;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were pronounced man and wife."</p>

	<p>"Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played &nbsp;&nbsp;once&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; week,&nbsp;&nbsp; once&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; year&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk. My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has &nbsp;&nbsp;ruined&nbsp;&nbsp; my voice.  Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass.  But that doesn't mean &nbsp;&nbsp;I've &nbsp;&nbsp;lost&nbsp;&nbsp; hope "</p> 
	<br>
	<p>". . .that someone will &nbsp;&nbsp;hold&nbsp;&nbsp; me in a &nbsp;&nbsp;tender embrace,&nbsp;&nbsp; her arms will encircle my neck;  someone will press her warm length to my back, and &nbsp;&nbsp;pluck notes&nbsp;&nbsp; from my gut with her fingers' caress. "</p>
