	<p>"Musical instruments sleep in the dark  for several hours a day:  the folks we belong to aren't always at play, so we can't always be at work."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"Our silence holds music: an undiscovered bourne, horizons which have never been viewed, like undeclared love growing deeper in solitude, or the crystalline heart of a stone."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"My sleep, however, was more like a death:  in the dark of an attic for years;  forgetting my existence, and my glorious career with the best female swing band on the earth."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"I was the great love of my Sweetheart's life. "</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"A man came between us."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"And soon  I was in the dark collecting dust and out of tune; they were pronounced man and wife."</p>
    <br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"Instead of the charts, my gal read Dr. Spock. We played once a week, once a year . . .  At first, from my closet, I was able to hear her family's coninuo of talk."</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"My Sweetheart's grandson brought me to the shop. Something has ruined my voice. "</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"Older, not riper, I'm a sorry old bass. "</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"But that doesn't mean I've lost hope 
	. . .that someone will hold me in a tender embrace, her arms will encircle my neck;  someone will press her warm length to my back, and pluck notes from my gut with her fingers' caress."</p>
